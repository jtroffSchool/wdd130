    <p>
        To whomever may be reading this. My name is Jeremy Troff. I have been married
        to my beautiful wife for almost 8 years. We have two little boys, a cat, and
        a dog all under the age of 4. Thanks for taking the time to get to know me
        a little bit better and I hope to have a chance to interact with you.

        I have been a member all my life. I served a mission in Finland where I served
        in several different cities throughout the country. I had the opportunity
        to visit the real north pole and even got to eat reindeer at a city near
        the north pole called Rovaneimi (Pronounced Roe-va-knee-em-mi).

        As far as hobbies go, I love games of all kinds. My favorite system is Nintendo
        and I have to say I enjoy JRPGs the most. I love board/card games and have
        over 150 different games/expansions. My wife also really enjoys playing games
        with me so it is easy to enjoy the hobby.

        As far as career goes I am currently working as a QA Engineer for the Church
        of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints as a Vendor. My parent company is a company
        called STG which I have been with for only the last four months. I am pursuing
        a bachelor's of Applied Technology to help me in the realm of QA as I move
        toward learning Automation.
