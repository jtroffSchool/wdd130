        in the form of the adventure one would take and the affordable pricing,
        we want to ensure that people can share their own experiences as they
        adventure forth.

Follow the instructions on the activity in Canvas then return and replace the color codes below with the hex color codes (the 6 digit numbers that show at the bottom of each color) for the colors you have chosen below.  You should have at least 2 colors but do not have to fill in all 4 if you do not need them.  -->
