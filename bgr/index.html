                <p>
                    Talisman is a RPG board game where you take control of one of a variety of different
                    characters and attempt to beat everyone else to the crown of power. To progress
                    you will have to overcome events, visit shops, and take down a variety of creatures
                    both mortal and not so mortal. As you progress your strength in both mind and body
                    will increase until you are strong enough to challenge the trials of the inner circle.
                    Games can take anywhere from 2-10 hours depending on who are you playing with, so it
                    is not for the faint of heart. Do you have what it takes to become the greatest in
                    all the land?
