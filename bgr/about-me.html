                    I love board games. I have been playing board games since as far back
                    as I can remember. After getting married my wife and I decided that
                    we needed to start our own collection of games since we enjoyed playing
                    together so much and what started out as getting a game here or there has
                    grown to over 150 games in our collection. We do not plan on stopping
                    any time soon. I have also loved being able to recommend games to everyone
                    that will take the time to listen to me. Playing games is a lot of fun but
                    there is a great satisfaction when you hear that other people liked your
                    game recommendation so much they purchased the game themselves. Both of
                    these loves is what sprouted the idea of extending my reach out to all of
                    you. I sincerely hope you can find a recommendation that you will enjoy
                    for many years to come!

                    I enjoy games of all kinds, but my favorite game is Talisman. 
                    This game is not for everyone though since it can take 2-10 hours 
                    to complete a game, but I have always really enjoyed it. Fair warning 
                    to anyone that wants to try it though, it is a little hard to find 
                    a group and time to play such a long game. I have all fourteen 
                    expansions that go with the game but you do not need all the expansions
                    to have a great time.
