      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <h3>Purpose</h3>
      <p>I love board games. I play board games on a weekly basis.
          I own over a 150 board/card games.
          I have a big circle of friends that play games with me.
          Any chance that we get we share our opinions on the different games that we play.
          This has led to a lot of people purchasing games that we recommended and giving feedback about their experience.
          So many people enjoy playing games. Sometimes it is hard to sort through the thousands of different games that you can find online.
          Having a convenient place to go for recommendations will help speed fun to future game nights.
          Those that start exploring will then want to return the favor spreading the joy of games for all.
        </p>  <!-- change this -->


      <h3>Audience</h3>
      <p>Everyone looking for a recommendation is welcome here. Games are meant to be shared so that
          we might all have fun together. I want to reach as many people as I can.
          I want to cultivate somewhere where everyone can share together. I have had the pleasure of
          recommending games to people from ages 12-80 and wish to continue doing so. Board Game Reviewers
          aims to bring all together in fun and adventure. I hope others will want to share their own recommendations.

        Content

      <h3>Home page</h3>
      <p>
        Hook - You walk into a game store and there are hundreds of games to choose from. There are even more if you decide to try and search the internet. When you come here we have filtered it down to our favorites. Whether you choose one, many, or we give you an idea for others we aim to provide your recommendation needs.
        Game of the Month  - Most websites have something showy up front to showcase their website. I want to highlight one game every week to bring it to light. These will probably mostly consist of Family/Party games since that is everyoneâ€™s favorite. Maybe implement a submission area where people can vote on what they want the game of the month to be to include extra community participation
        Others Contribute - Everyone is welcome to contribute their own recommendations. After reviewing and trying the game out myself you could find your recommendation on the site
        Why Come - I could be mistaken but I have not seen a site quite like this one. Of course, there are plenty of review sites but all the ones that I have seen focus on quantity over quality. It can still be hard to find good recommendations on those types of sites since you need to have an idea of what you are looking for. We aim to have a site where you can just browse for moments and be able to walk away with a good recommendation to try.

      <h3>Categories</h3>
      <p>
        Family/Party Games - Games that you can play with your family are usually everyone's go-to when searching for recommendations. Games need to be easy enough to learn, fun, and be able to allow large numbers of players. This category will have the most recommendations since it is the categories I get to play the most.
        Gamers - There are many out there looking for a little bit more than 15-minute rounds to a game. This category aims to please that audience looking for a little bit more of a challenge than just the family games.
        Puzzle Games - This is not a category that you see very often. There will not be as many games in this category but sometimes you just need to embrace your logical thinking side instead of relying on luck.
        Many More Categories - The great thing about board/card games is that there are so many different genres and categories out there. As the traffic/interaction of the site grows this section could grow to be bigger and bigger. Of course, we still want to focus on quality over quantity but I feel like that would not be super hard to manage.

      <h3>About Me</h3>
      <p>
        About Me - My name is Jeremy Troff. I have loved playing games of all kinds since I was a little kid. After getting married I started collecting board games of all kinds so that my wife and family could play. My collection has grown to over 150 games and I am always on the lookout to add more. As my collection grew I started to become the go to guy for bringing games to game nights or to ask when someone wanted a recommendation. I have always taken great pride in seeing others enjoy games that I have recommended.
        My Favorite - I enjoy games of all kinds, but my favorite game is Talisman. This game is not for everyone though since it can take 3-12 hours to complete a game, but I have always really enjoyed it. Fair warning to anyone that wants to try it though, it is a little hard to find a group and time to play such a long game.
